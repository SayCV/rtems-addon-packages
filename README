Assorted add-on packages for RTEMS.

The bit script builds and installs all the packages.

To build a package:
	cd <<whatever_package_you_want_to_build>>
	make -f ../RTEMS_Makefiles/Makefile.<<package_name>>

Notes
=====
1) You must build and install the host version of infocmp before trying to
build ncurses.
2) You must build and install ncurses before trying to build readline.
3) To add ncurses support for other terminals, change the declaration
   of TERMINALS.

Cautions
========
The readline and ncurses `configure' scripts check for the presence of
select().  Because the RTEMS dummy.rel file does not include network
configuration information the scripts decide that select() does not
exist.  This is correct since although RTEMS does have a select() call
it is not supported on tty devices.  The fact that one shortcoming is
covering up another is not really satisfactory, though.
